  "readme": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lmccart/p5.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lmccart/p5.js)\n\n#p5.js\n\n[Hello!](http://hello.p5js.org/) p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.\n\nUsing the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, you're not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch! For this, p5.js has addon libraries that make it easy to interact with other HTML5 objects, including text, input, video, webcam, and sound.\n\np5.js is a new interpretation, not an emulation or port, and it is in active development. An official editing environment is coming soon, as well as many more features!\n\nIf you already know the basics of JS or Processing, the [p5.js overview](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview) wiki page is a good place to start. The [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) might also be helpful.\n\nIf you have found a bug in the p5.js library, you can file it here under the [“issues” tab](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues). \n\n##p5.js library\n\nYou can [download the p5.js library here](http://p5js.org/download) or use `lib/p5.js` for the less stable, newest version.\n\n##Learning\n\n* [Get Started](http://p5js.org/get-started) — Create and run your first sketch!\n* [p5.js overview](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview) — An overview of the main features and functionality of p5.js.\n* [Reference](http://p5js.org/reference) — The functionality supported by p5.js.\n* [Learn](http://p5js.org/learn) — Tutorials and short, prototypical examples exploring the basics of p5.js.\n* [Forum](http://forum.processing.org/two/) — Ask and answers questions about how to make things with p5.js here.\n* [Libraries](http://p5js.org/libraries) — Extend p5 functionality to interact with HTML, manipulate sound, and more!\n* [FAQ](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\n\n##Get Involved\n\np5.js is a collaborative project created by many individuals, and you are invited to help. All types of involvement are welcome. See the [contribute section](http://p5js.org/contribute) to get started!\n\nDevelopers, check out the [development](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Development) wiki page for more in-depth details about contributing code, bug fixes, and documentation.\n\n\n\n",
